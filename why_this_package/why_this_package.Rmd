```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

For these reasons:

## urban/rural update data
The census API does provide 2010 census summary file 1 with urban/rural update data, for example,

```{r}
library(tidycensus)
# change the api to your owns
census_api_key("ab664ab627f56ed01df0b97a25f6f473598a7fec")

# all urban/rural population are returned as zero.
popul_ur <- get_decennial(state = "RI", geography = "county", 
                          variables = c("P0020001", "P0020002", "P0020003", "P0020004", "P0020005"),
                          year = 2010)
```

## easy combination of data
For example block data of a city or metro, which is hard to do with the API packages
```{r}
library(rawcensus2010)

```
