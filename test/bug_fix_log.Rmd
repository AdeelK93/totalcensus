# read_acs5() unable to read metro data, 20181205 

This is a bug to v0.5.0, which yield zero rows of data for the following code:
```{r}
home_ny <- read_acs5year(
    year = 2016,
    states = "NY",
    table_contents = "home_value = B25077_001",
    areas = "New York metro",
    summary_level = "block group",
    with_margin = FALSE
)
```
